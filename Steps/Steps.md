Steps in the Job Market Process

1.  Familiarize yourself with this document, [`Timetable`](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/People/Ccarroll/JobMarket/Timetable), and [`FAQ`](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/People/Ccarroll/JobMarket/FAQ); in all communications I will expect you to have thoroughly digested the information contained in all of the resources I have provided.

2.  In your initial email to the JMPO and JMCC (see [`Timetable`](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/People/Ccarroll/JobMarket/Timetable) for timing; see [`Notation`](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/People/Ccarroll/JobMarket/Notation) for definitions of who the JMPO and JMCC are), indicate what your [`Moniker`](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/jobmarket/Notation) is (don’t forget the middle initial\! see [`Notation`](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/jobmarket/Notation)), your main advisor, second advisor, job paper title, year in the JHU program, and assessment of likelihood you will actually be on the market (for students before 6th year).

3.  In early September, a login entry will be created for you using your [`Moniker`](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/jobmarket/Notation) in the database that I have set up to keep track of job market candiates, [`jhuEconPeople`](http://jhueconpeople.dynalias.org)  (its full url is at the end of this document). Don’t be worried about the information you put in this database; it is mainly for internal purposes and we will not (for example) put your phone number on the internet. But we do <span>*need*</span> your phone number so that you can be contacted quickly if necessary (in response to an inquiry from an employer, e.g.). <span>*In addition,*</span> write a short memo about yourself for me and your advisor(s) that includes most of the facts you have entered into the database, as well as crucial extra content. In this memo, <span>*briefly*</span> describe your job market paper topic, sketch the rest of your dissertation, mention any other research, and say something about teaching interests. Give a tentative title for your job market paper and dissertation (this can change later, in the database). Say what kinds of jobs you are most interested in (e.g. university vs. teaching college vs. non-academic, large vs. small school) and any geographic preferences or restrictions. Note any special selling points (e.g. good TA ratings), or special connections that could result in a job offer outside the usual channels. Include both primary and ‘backup’ contact information so we can always find you quickly. Also include visa status information. <span>*This document must not be more than 2 pages.*</span> Call this document, e.g., `MemoCarrollCD.pdf`, post it at the root of your `job market directory` (which should correspond to your moniker; see [`Notation`](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/People/Ccarroll/JobMarket/Notation)), email it to the JMPO and your dissertation advisers, and you’re done.

4.  Note that you do not want to make an unfavorable impression on the job market coordinator by being someone I have to hassle to get you to do things like this job market memo. Please do these things on time without my having to pester you.

5.  Note that you <span>*may*</span> need to pester <span>*me*</span> or your advisor to do things that we are supposed to be doing. Don’t be shy about doing this; for pestering your advisor, you can blame me and the timetables I have posted (of which all the faculty are aware). If you need to pester me, you can remind me of my own schedules and that I have encouraged you to pester me.

6.  Schedule a practice job talk for a date sometime in October in one of the department’s workshops (if it is impossible to schedule a date before the beginning of November, then you can take one later; but it is <span>*strongly*</span> preferred to do so before the first week of November). (Your presentation must be prepared using the <span> *Beamer*</span> package for <span>LaTeX</span>.) Make sure to confirm that your advisors can attend on the date of your workshop. In advance of the workshop, recruit one of your fellow grad students to take detailed notes on any questions or discussions that arise during your seminar. Also, arrange to make sure that someone is in charge of making a video recording of your pitiful performance using the department’s digital videocam (the JMCC will explain to all of you how this works); seeing yourself on camera will prove to be the most effective way to encourage you to correct the cringe-inducing defects in your presentation style.

7.  Get an AEA student membership. Reliable sources tell us that the registration process allows you to indicate areas of interest and to somehow indicate that you may be on the job market this year. Some recruiters may actually use this information\!

8.  Register to attend the AEA meetings, and try to get a room in the hotel where most interviews will take place (the ‘headquarters’ hotel). Don’t wait until the last minute, because late registrations do not get included in the directory of who is staying where, so employers may not be able to find you. Plan to arrive no later than midday or early afternoon on the day before the first sessions; in some cases employers might ask to interview you on the afternoon of that day.

9.  Produce a CV (3 pages or less-<span>*no exceptions*</span>) and a dissertation abstract (using the provided template and following the examples of previous generations of students) by <span>*early*</span> October. The abstract must be approved by your advisor (and this is a good time to discuss with the advisor what you expect will be the contents of the entire dissertation). The abstract must fit on one (1) page (that is, it must be fewer than two pages, which is to say that the number of pages cannot exceed \(e^{-\iota \pi}\)); it must use at least an 11 point font, and have margins of at least 1.2 inches. Title at top, followed by name, followed by text. <span>*Use the templates provided.*</span> Post both the PDF and the `.tex` documents in your root `job market directory`, so others can learn from your pitiful `.tex` efforts and can be slightly less pitiful themselves.

10. Once your CV, abstract, and job market paper are ready, it will be <span>*your*</span> responsibility to post them into the folder that the department will create under your [`Moniker`](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/jobmarket/Notation). Instructions can be found at the `JMCC Help` web page listed below, under the header `JobMarketComputerHelp`. To see what the final page will look like, go to <http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/2016/>. (The page <http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/computing-resources/> may also contain answers to technical questions.)

11. In order for your job market webpages to be created in a timely fashion, fill out the `template.txt` file in your server folder promptly. Your web pages should contain only the most essential information pertaining to your research, teaching, awards, and references. The details are supposed to be in your CV. As an example, please look at the following pages:  
    <http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/2012/CareyCM/> <http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/2007/ThomKE/>

12. Produce a finished job market paper by October 1, and send a copy to your advisor and anyone who you will be asking to write letters for you, and post it in your folder on the server. It should be complete, polished, well-written, and nicely formatted. It should look like something ready to send to a journal, not a work in progress. It must be written using <span>LaTeX</span> – NOT Word, NOT Scientific Word – <span>LaTeX</span>. (It’s fine to have an additional paper or two ready, but quality is <span>*much*</span> more important than quantity; if you have to make a choice between completing a second or third paper, and polishing the job market paper, polish.)

13. After you have obtained your advisors’ approval for your list of places you plan to apply to (and for your job market paper), you will follow the procedures in the <http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/jobmarket/RecLetters/> directory to get recommendation letters sent on your behalf.

14. <span id="Signal"><span>**Signal**</span> </span>In the latter half of November, the AEA job registration process allows you to designate no more than two employers to whom you want to “signal” special interest. (See the url at the end of this document). These signals, in some cases, actually have value because each person has only two of them. Though you should not obsess about where to send your “signals” you should give it some thought – if you are a plausible candidate for a job at the institution in question, they will definitely pay more attention to your application if they receive your “signal.” It will single out your application from the 400 others they will have received. They might receive only 10 “signals” so they can afford to pay close attention to those applications.

15. In early December, we will schedule mock interviews in which Hopkins faculty pretend to be interviewers at the AEA meetings and grill you as you will be grilled there.

16. Between early December and late December, employers who are potentially interested in you will contact you to schedule an interview at the AEA meetings. It is vital that during this period (even over the holidays) you are in touch with your email and phone messages. If you will be away, learn how to retrieve voicemail messages from your answering machine before you go\! (Or list as your contact phone number a cellphone number that will work wherever you may go; note that you CANNOT expect employers to hunt you down - the phone number you provide to them should succeed in contacting you with 100 percent probability).

17. Prepare for the interviews; several students have provided detailed advice, which I have posted in the “Resources” directory of my job market page. Also, the document `Practice.Interviews.Student.Preparation.doc` provides an excellent overview and guidance. One further requirement is to be able to articulate an explicit plan for when your dissertation will be completed and what it will consist of; many employers, in interviews, will ask this question, and you need to have an answer (approved by your advisor) ready at hand. <span id="InterviewPrep"></span>

18. Beginning in late January, and extending to late March, employers who are still interested in you will call to schedule a job talk.

19. After any given job talk, an employer can wait anywhere from a day to two months before getting back in touch with you. But it is socially acceptable for you to call or email to ask for an update on your status.

20. If you don’t have a job by late March, don’t despair. In the end, experience shows that eventually everyone finds a job\!

21. When your final job status is resolved (that is, when you accept a job offer), email me, your advisors, and the JMCC to make sure we have the info.

One activity that does not fit neatly into the chronological framework articulated above is the process of developing the list of places you want to apply to. You should start this process as soon as your advisor gives you preliminary approval to be on the market. Periodically check Job Openings for Economists (JOE) (available from the AEA) for job listings. You might also check listings from the Financial Management Association and the National Association of Business Economists. If you are interested in overseas jobs, look at the European JOE and the ads in the <span>*Economist*</span>. (If you discover job listings that may be of interest to your classmates, please let them know).

You will ultimately need to generate form letters to the employers you plan to apply to, and will need various kinds of information about them (like email addresses and phone numbers) as you work your way through the process. Over the years, we have developed a standardized Excel spreadsheet template that contains slots for all the information you will need to collect, available in the [`Templates`](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/jobmarket/Templates) folder as `EmployersMoniker.xls`. You <span>*MUST*</span> use (a renamed version of) this Excel spreadsheet template when you send out your mailing (because you want to use the linked form-letter-generating software); therefore, to avoid confusing yourself by having multiple lists, you should start your process by downloading the spreadsheet `EmployersMoniker.xls` from the  directory. Rename it to, e.g., `EmployersCarrollCD.xls`, erase the information that is in it (unless you want to apply to some of the example employers included in the template file – in which case, you still need to verify that they are hiring this year and the contact information has remained the same). Please <span>*do not*</span> rearrange or rename the columns in this template – in the end, the JMPO will need to merge all of the students’ templates in order to have a manageable idea of who has applied where, and you do not want to piss off the JMPO at this crucial time by making extra work in the form of figuring out what you have renamed columns to and where you have moved them to. (You are welcome to add extra columns beyond those in the template, and hide those that you don’t need to use; but do NOT rename or reorder them\!).

When you have developed a list of places to which you wish to apply, make an appointment with your advisor(s) to discuss the list. When you and your advisor(s) have agreed on the final list, you will need to give copies of the list to the people who are writing reference letters. See [`RecLetters`](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/People/Ccarroll/JobMarket/RecLetters) for procedures. For academic employers, some will ask for evidence of teaching skills; here, there is no clear-cut standard for what they expect to receive, but student evaluations of your performance (including a few choice quotes from the student evaluation forms) are a good idea. Do NOT send more than a page or two of info on this subject - nobody will read more than this, so distill everything down to the essence.

Err on the side of too many applications rather than too few. But don’t waste everyone’s time by applying to places that you would turn down under all possible circumstances.

One more point: You should have a regular computer backup plan (ideally, an automatic backup every night; at a minimum, once a week) for all the computer files that are critical to your thesis research, job market paper, and application process. Without a backup, you are at risk of losing months worth of work or more, and in a worst case scenario it could mean you will have to withdraw from the job market. In 2003 one student’s laptop crashed right in the middle of the job market. Fortunately the student had a week-old backup of the key files; but let that be a warning.

The Advice category is particularly noteworthy, as it contains (among other things) a variety of documents specifically written by either JHU students or JHU faculty with their personal advice about various aspects of the job market process. For example, the document `AdviceMoffittInterviews.doc` contains advice Robert Moffitt has provided about how to handle job market interviews.

One of you (the students on the job market) should create an emailing list for you to email each other with gossip, tips, useful urls that you discover, job listings that others might not have seen, etc.
